Based off of the xbox 360 hud where everything is closer to the middle
Put the "360hud" folder inside your steam/steamapps/common/team fortress 2/tf/custom folder
Credit goes to Snowshoe for TF2HUD+ which is merged with this hud
Credit also goes to the creators of Frankenhud for letting me use the tf2 styled text hud mod.
If you don't like the way that the chat looks, delete clientscheme.res and chatscheme.res in the resource folder.
Disable the minimal hud option and turn off the 3d player model
NOTE: Deleting clientscheme.res and chatscheme.res will disable the fonts in the killfeed, and the fonts for the scoreboard.
